# ENPM661-Project3
This project is an implementation of A* path planning algorithm in a continuous workspace for a holonomic robot. 

To run the program, enter the following in your terminal 
$python Astar_rigid.py

Upon running the script, the user will be prompted to enter the desired starting configuration (x, y, theta) and the ending configuration (x, y) of the robot. An error message will be displayed if any of the points lie within the obstacle or outside the workspace. 

Note: The dependencies required to run this program are numpy, and matplotlib,
