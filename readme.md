# ENPM661-Project3
This project is an implementation of A* path planning algorithm in a continuous workspace for a holonomic robot. 

To run the program, enter the following in your terminal 
$python Astar_rigid.py

Upon running the script, the user will be prompted to enter the robot's radius, clerance, step size, desired starting configuration (x, y, theta) and the ending configuration (x, y). An error message will be displayed if any of the start or end points lie within the obstacle or outside the workspace. 

Note: The dependencies required to run this program are numpy and opencv
